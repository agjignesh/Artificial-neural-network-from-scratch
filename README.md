# Artificial-neural-network-from-scratch
In this I have created an Artificial neural model from scratch which can be used to create various types of Neural network architectures


In this there is one ANN.py file which is the brain and contains all the code for the neural network it contains various activation

Then there is the XOR.py and Mnsit.py file which creates a neural network of diffrent archtechures according to there use and use them to solve the XOR and hand written numbers classification problem. 

# Use this link to play with the AI using the link bellow

## steps to use the colab file
First Run all the cells in a sequential order once the model is trained to a 100% you can test the model in the play ground section
